## üìù Reflection:
## üß† Reflection

For over five hours, I wrestled with Git misfires, remote mismatches, authentication loops, and nested repo confusion‚Äîall while navigating the delicate structure of my Azure VM lab folder. Each error felt like a wall, but I treated every one as a lesson. I reconfigured remotes, corrected branch paths, and retraced my steps until the push finally landed. What began as a technical task became a test of patience and persistence. Now, my project lives on GitHub‚Äînot just as code, but as proof that I don‚Äôt quit when things get hard. I troubleshoot, I learn, and I finish strong.

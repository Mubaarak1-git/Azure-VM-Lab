# Azure VM Deployment and configuration lab
In this lab, I demonstrate how to deploy and configure a Virtual Machine (VM) using the Microsoft Azure portal. I walk through the full setup process‚Äîfrom creating the VM to configuring availability zones, security settings, and network components.

I also attach and configure additional disks, manage inbound and outbound network access, and ensure that associated resources like public IPs and network interfaces (NICs) are properly cleaned up when the VM is deleted. This lab showcases my ability to manage Azure compute resources with precision and best practices.

## üéØ Lab Objectives ‚Äì Azure Virtual Machine Deployment
- I explored the importance of deploying virtual machines in Microsoft Azure to support scalable and secure cloud infrastructure.

- I learned how to create a VM using the Azure portal, configuring key settings such as availability zones, operating system, and authentication methods.

- I gained hands-on experience attaching and configuring additional disks to enhance storage performance and flexibility.

- I managed network access by configuring inbound and outbound rules, ensuring secure connectivity to and from the VM.

- I verified that associated resources‚Äîsuch as public IP addresses and network interfaces (NICs)are properly removed when the VM is deleted, maintaining clean resource hygiene.

## üìù Reflection:


For over five hours, I wrestled with Git misfires, remote mismatches, authentication loops, and nested repo confusion‚Äîall while navigating the delicate structure of my Azure VM lab folder. Each error felt like a wall, but I treated every one as a lesson. I reconfigured remotes, corrected branch paths, and retraced my steps until the push finally landed. What began as a technical task became a test of patience and persistence. Now, my project lives on GitHub‚Äînot just as code, but as proof that I don‚Äôt quit when things get hard. I troubleshoot, I learn, and I finish strong.
